Then it applies a different policy for each category. It stores Small KV pairs inside the LSM levels (as RocksDB). It always performs key-value separation for KV pairs (as BlobDB), writing them in a value log, and it uses a garbage collection (GC) mechanism for the value log. For medium KV pairs, it uses a hybrid policy: It performs KV separation up to the semi-last levels and then stores them in place to bulk-free space without using GC.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"db9b9fb4f5295afb558fbc51a8d5f2e7","permalink":"https://gxanth.com/project/parallax/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/parallax/","section":"project","summary":"Parallax is an LSM-based persistent key-value store designed for flash storage devices (SSDs, NVMe).
